# Five Programming Problems #

Inspired by [Five programming problems every Software Engineer should be able to solve in less than 1 hour](https://blog.svpino.com/2015/05/07/five-programming-problems-every-software-engineer-should-be-able-to-solve-in-less-than-1-hour)

## Problems ##

### Problem 1 ###

> Write three functions that compute the sum of the numbers in a given
> list using a for-loop, a while-loop, and recursion.

### Problem 2 ###

> Write a function that combines two lists by alternatingly taking
> elements. For example: given the two lists `[a, b, c]` and
> `[1, 2, 3]`, the function should return `[a, 1, b, 2, c, 3]`.

### Problem 3 ###

> Write a function that computes the list of the first 100 Fibonacci
> numbers. By definition, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci
> sequence are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the
> previous two. As an example, here are the first 10 Fibonnaci
> numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and 34.

### Problem 4 ###

> Write a function that given a list of non negative integers,
> arranges them such that they form the largest possible number. For
> example, given [50, 2, 1, 9], the largest formed number is 95021.

### Problem 5 ###

> Write a program that outputs all possibilities to put + or - or
> nothing between the numbers 1, 2, ..., 9 (in this order) such that
> the result is always 100. For example: 1 + 2 + 34 – 5 + 67 – 8 + 9 =
> 100.

## Commentry ##

Nope, I didn't solve these problems in less then 1 hour. :) Mostly
because I was doing this at the weekend and I had plenty of other
things to do.
